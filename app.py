        This application predicts the expected delivery time for an order based on the following details:
        - Product Category
        - Customer Location
        - Shipping Method
        - Order Weight
        - Distance to Customer

        **How It Works:**
        - The app uses a machine learning model (or placeholder logic) to estimate delivery time.
        - You can upload historical data to train your own model.

        **Technologies Used:**
        - Python
        - Streamlit
        - Machine Learning (optional)
